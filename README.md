## Journey

More important than the destination.

- get storybook working and transfer existing components
- polish homepage examples (slider promotion grid) and work on style extensibility / configuration
- build a minimal test environment to mock graphql based state
- build the product element with properties based on schema.org. state should 'serialize' to the JSON-LD compatible definition.
- as much as possible make the element be abstract with options and simple sensible defaults.
- keep it simple stupid
- ensure the mixers have a form that is simple enough to extend or custom-roll.
- build a simple github demo site

## Prerequisites

These custom elements should work in most modern web frameworks. Check out some of the [caveats](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) related to your building material of choice.
